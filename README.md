# simplelib
`simplelib` is a student project aimed at learning
and building efficient, fundamental data structures 
and algorithms in C. The goal of this library is to
focus on performance, simplicity, and a solid
understanding of low-level implementation details
while building useful tools.

The ultimate goal is to get my custom-written
C compiler found ([zcc](https://github.com/diogoos/zcc))
to run programs that are linked with simplelib.
This will take a long time and may not happen.

## Features
- Lightweight, fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Built with performance and simplicity in mind.
- Aimed at learning and building efficient, low-level implementations.

> [!TIP]
> The considerations behind the design and implementation of this library
> are listed in the [**IMPLEMENTATION.md**](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) file.

## Progress
- [x] FNV Hashing
- [x] Hash Maps
- [ ] Red/black trees
- [ ] BFS and DFS
- [ ] Other hashing algorithms

## Usage
Include the necessary header files and link `libsimplelib`
during the compilation of your program.
